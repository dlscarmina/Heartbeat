# Heart/Beat
_Embedded Systems Project_

Heart/Beat is a heart rate visualization device. The user straps a heart rate monitor around their chest which detects pulse. Each pulse is recorded and after 10 seconds, an estimated beats per minute (BPM) value is calculated. Every time the BPM is updated, it is displayed on a Nokia LCD Display, and an LED Matrix visualizes the pulses by finding the period per pulse and displaying open/close ripple animations.
